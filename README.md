**Project topic:** Deep Learning Visual Speech Recognition Algorithm using DNN methodology

Our goal is to develop a DNN based algorithm which will receive voice-less (or will just
ignore voice) sort of "talking head" video of a speaking person as input and output everything the
person said as text, our mission is to tackle this problem as an "open world
problem" – we want our system to be able to work well with the whole language,
this means – we're not trying to learn only specific syllables, phrases or words.

the accuracy of generated text (in comparison to what actually been said) should
be high, i.e. the algorithm should be useful and well working.

Our algorithm will work only with English, and as a start we'd try to run it on
clear video, without additional noises, as a later desire - we'll try to make it
work with not as clear videos i.e. a person which is moving often, a person
which is standing in a relatively great distance from the camera, out of sync
video, etc…

Our research of existing products in this field revealed that there are papers
which try to solve the "lip reading" problem with non-deep learning methods, we
found papers about using CNN to try and find phonemes or visemes on still images, and
there are some deep learning products such as "LipNet" which try to achieve the
same goal as we do, additionally, we found this paper
[<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.02108v2.pdf>] from about a year ago which deals
with this problem, so this is possible, and there is already done research to
work with and compare our results to.

As a product, there is a lot of possible uses for this kind of system, main usage could be integration in a larger "video to text" system as a singel compenent which deals spesificly with lip reading.
